🦿 "Every frame a painting, every line of code a brushstroke." - My programming journey began during my final year studying Audiovisual Communication, where I took a course on Digital Information Services Development. What started as a curiosity soon became my passion: crafting immersive digital experiences.

🎨 Front-end is my canvas. I love designing clean, accessible, responsive interfaces with CSS, JavaScript and modern frameworks like Angular. Whether it's the perfect typography or the smoothest animations, I strive for the polish of a Kubrick frame and the precision of a Fincher cut.

    💡 My stack includes:

      🎭 JavaScript & TypeScript – because every good story needs a solid script.

      🏗️ HTML & CSS (Sass, Bootstrap) – building visually compelling layouts, where every pixel has a purpose.

      ⚙️ Symfony & MySQL – structuring the backend like a well-written three-act screenplay.

      🚀 Angular – orchestrating components like an ensemble cast in a perfectly timed scene.

      🌱 "There's always a bigger fish." - I'm constantly learning and refining my skills in UX/UI design, CSS animations, and performance optimization to make every project not just functional, but delightful.

📫 Feel free to reach out! Whether it’s about web development, front-end magic, or just geeking out over cinema.
