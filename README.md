# 🎨 Frontend Developer in Progress  

## 🦿 My Journey  
My programming path began during my final year  
of **Audiovisual Communication**, where I took a course  
on **Digital Information Services Development**.  

What started as curiosity soon became a passion:  
**crafting immersive digital experiences** with a strong  
emphasis on usability, aesthetics, and performance.  

## 🎨 The Art of Frontend  
For me, **frontend development is a form of digital storytelling**.  
Every interface should be as visually compelling as it is functional,  
with clean layouts, seamless interactions, and well-structured code.  

I focus on **responsive design, accessibility, and smooth animations**,  
ensuring that every element on the screen serves a purpose.  
Precision in structure and attention to detail are key  
to delivering high-quality user experiences.  

## 💡 Tech Stack  

- 🎭 **JavaScript & TypeScript** – Writing clear, maintainable code  
  for dynamic applications.  
- 🏗️ **HTML & CSS (Sass, Bootstrap, Tailwind)** –  
  Crafting structured and visually engaging designs.  
- ⚙️ **Symfony & MySQL** – Managing backend logic and data efficiently.  
- 🚀 **Angular** – Building modular, scalable, and interactive UIs.  

## 🌱 Always Learning  
The web is constantly evolving, and so am I.  
I’m always exploring **UX/UI design principles, CSS animations,**  
and **performance optimization** to enhance both usability and aesthetics.  

My goal is to create experiences that feel **natural, fluid, and intuitive**.
