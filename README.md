🦿 My programming journey began during my final year of my degree in Audiovisual Communication, when I discovered Digital Information Services Development. What started as curiosity quickly became a passion: creating immersive, interactive digital experiences.

🎓 I’m now a Web Development graduate, adding technical depth to my creative foundations.

🎨 Front-end is my creative playground. I enjoy crafting clean, accessible, responsive interfaces using CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like Angular. I approach design with the polish of a Kubrick frame and the precision of a Fincher cut — every detail matters.

💡 My tech stack:

    🎭 JavaScript & TypeScript — every good story needs a solid script.
    🏗️ HTML & CSS (Sass, Bootstrap) — building layouts where every pixel earns its place.
    ⚙️ Symfony & MySQL — backend architecture structured like a well-written three-act screenplay.
    🚀 Angular — orchestrating components like an ensemble cast hitting every cue on time.

📫 Let’s connect! Whether it’s about web development, front-end magic, or just geeking out about cinema.
